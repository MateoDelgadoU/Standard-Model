# Standard Model of Particle Physics

An interactive visualization of the Standard Model of particle physics.

## What is the Standard Model?

The Standard Model is a theory that describes the fundamental particles that make up all matter in the universe and the forces that govern their interactions. It classifies particles into two main categories:

- **Fermions**: Matter particles (quarks and leptons) organized into three generations
- **Bosons**: Force-carrying particles that mediate interactions between fermions

The model includes 17 fundamental particles: 12 fermions (6 quarks and 6 leptons) and 5 bosons (4 gauge bosons and the Higgs boson).

## How it's Built

This web application is built with:

- **React 19** - UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **Lucide React** - Icons

The application uses pure CSS animations for smooth interactions and a minimalist dark theme inspired by the cosmos.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Start development server:
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

3. Build for production:
```bash
pnpm run build
```
